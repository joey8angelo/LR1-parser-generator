# LR1 Parser Generator
An LR(1) parser generator. Input an LR(1) grammar with space seperated tokens into grammarInput.txt, the first rule is the start rule. Numbers should not be tokens, reserved tokens are "$" and "%". Use "%" for epsilon. Input a stream of tokens into input.txt to syntactically analyze it. The program will output accept if there were no syntax errors, and report errors otherwise.
